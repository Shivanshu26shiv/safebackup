# safebackup

- This script takes cyclic backups based on MAX_NO_OF_BACKUPS
- Checks latest backup repo before taking backup, if identical, it skips
- Ideally scheduled via task scheduler at every logon
- To see the latest backup, refresh windows explorer
- Ideally, only need to change variables in CAPS
